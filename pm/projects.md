This project [charter](./project-charter.md) is further broken into three projects. The first project is the foundation, which includes the infrastructure setup, system architecture, and data pipeline development.
The second project is the core features, which includes the inventory management, temperature monitoring, order processing, and alert system. The third project is the intelligence layer, which includes the demand forecasting, product classification, and RAG implementation. The project also includes a user interface, which is responsible for the management dashboard, mobile app integration, reporting system, and API documentation. The risk assessment matrix provides a comprehensive overview of the project's risks and their potential impact on the project's success. The success metrics section provides a detailed breakdown of the project's technical and business KPIs.


Here is rough technical stack of the project.

#### Data Engineering

**Project: Real-Time Data Pipeline for E-commerce Analytics**

- **Technologies Used:** Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Delta Lake, AWS S3
- **Objective:** To build a real-time data pipeline that ingests, processes, and stores e-commerce data for analytics.
- **Implementation:**
  - Set up Kafka for real-time data ingestion from various e-commerce platforms.
  - Developed Spark jobs to process and transform the data in real-time.
  - Stored the processed data in Delta Lake on AWS S3 for efficient querying and analysis.
  - Implemented data quality checks and monitoring to ensure data accuracy and reliability.


#### AI Engineering

**Project: Advanced NLP Model for Customer Support Automation**

- **Technologies Used:** Llama, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Python, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Objective:** To develop an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that automates customer support interactions, improving response times and customer satisfaction.
- **Implementation:**
  - Utilized Llama for building and fine-tuning the NLP model to understand and generate human-like text.
  - Integrated LangChain to manage and orchestrate the different components of the NLP pipeline, ensuring seamless interaction between the model and other systems.
  - Leveraged LlamaIndex to efficiently index and retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of customer support data.
  - Containerized the model using Docker and deployed it on a Kubernetes cluster for scalable and reliable performance.
  - Implemented a user-friendly interface for customer support agents to interact with the model and provide real-time assistance.


#### Infrastructure Management

**Project: Scalable and Secure Cloud Infrastructure for a Startup**

- **Technologies Used:** Kubernetes, Terraform,  Prometheus, Grafana, AWS
- **Objective:** To design and implement a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure for a growing startup, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used Terraform to define and provision the cloud infrastructure, including VPCs, subnets, and security groups.
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline  to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
  - Implemented monitoring and alerting using Prometheus and Grafana to ensure high availability and performance.

Each concept is occean and it requires sufficient time and resources. I will document my progress and the results of my experiments into different repositories.

I unable to give timelines on completion of the project due to limited time and priority.
